## Future Improvements  

Things Iâ€™m currently working on and planning to add:  

- **Budget View Enhancements** â€“ more detailed breakdown of categories and monthly progress.  
- **Goals View** â€“ ability to set financial goals (e.g., travel fund, emergency savings) and track progress visually.  
- **Export & Import Data** â€“ save reports to CSV or PDF for offline tracking.  
- **Mood Tracking** â€“ Connect emotional awareness to your financial decisions.
- **Authentication:** Auth0 / JWT  

**Project Purpose**  
This application was developed as a **study project** during my full-stack web development training.  
The goal is to practice building a complete full-stack application using **React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Knex, and SQLite/PostgreSQL**, while applying concepts like authentication, state management, and database integration.
